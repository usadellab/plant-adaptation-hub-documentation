# ðŸ”¬ BLAST Search

This tool performs a BLASTN (Basic Local Alignment Search Tool) search. It takes a single nucleotide sequence and compares it against a database to find regions of local similarity. The results are displayed as cards, showing the most significant matches, their E-values, identity percentages, and genomic coordinates.

## 1. Query and Actions

### Query Input

The large text area is dedicated to receiving the query sequence.

| Input Type | Requirement | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Query Sequence** | Single nucleotide (DNA) sequence. | The sequence must be provided in raw text format (not FASTA, though the example implies raw sequence data). |

### Action Buttons

| Button | Function |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Run BLAST** | Initiates the search process using the query sequence against the configured database. |
| **Clear** | Clears the text editor of the query sequence. |
| **Example** | Pre-fills the input box with a sample query sequence for quick testing. |

## 2. Filter & Sort Controls

After the BLAST search is complete, users can refine the displayed results using the controls provided below the input area.

| Control | Type | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Max E-value** | Dropdown/Input | Sets the maximum acceptable **Expectation Value** (E-value) for a result to be shown. Lower E-values indicate higher reliability. |
| **Min Identity (%)** | Dropdown/Input | Sets the minimum required percentage of identical residues between the query and the matched sequence. |
| **Source** | Dropdown | Filters results based on the original data source of the matching sequence (e.g., specific genome assembly or annotation project). |
| **Organism** | Dropdown | Filters results to only show matches against a selected organism. |
| **Sort By** | Dropdown | Allows the user to order the result cards by different metrics (e.g., E-value, Identity, Location). |
| **Reset** | Button | Clears all active filters and sorting options, returning the view to the default result set. |

## 3. Search Result Cards

Each card represents a significant match (a "Hit") found by the BLAST algorithm.

### Key Match Statistics

The header of each card displays the most important statistics for the match:

* **Organism:** The species of the matching sequence.
* **Tax ID:** The NCBI Taxonomy ID for the organism.
* **E-value:** The probability due to chance that there is another alignment score as good as or better than the score given. **Lower is better.**
* **Identity (%):** The percentage of residues that are identical between the query and the hit in the aligned region.
* **Visual Identity Bar:** A colored bar that visually represents the identity percentage.

### Genomic Location

* **Location:** The chromosomal coordinates of the matching sequence within its organism's genome (e.g., `Chr01: 11065053 - 11065160`).
* **Assembly:** The specific assembly version the sequence belongs to.
* **Source:** The project or database the sequence was derived from (e.g., `SUN_X2`, `PhytoZyme`).
