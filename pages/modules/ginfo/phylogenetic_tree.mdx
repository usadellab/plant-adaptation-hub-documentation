# ðŸŒ³ Create Phylogenetic Tree

This module is a dedicated tool for evolutionary analysis. It processes multiple DNA or protein sequences in FASTA format, calculates a distance matrix, and constructs a phylogenetic tree using the **Neighbor-Joining algorithm** to represent the evolutionary relationships between the sequences.

## 1. Input and Generation

### Input Area

The main input area requires raw sequence data in **FASTA format** (maximum 50 sequences).

| Action | Function |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Generate Tree** | Executes the sequence alignment, distance matrix calculation, and phylogenetic tree construction. |
| **Clear** | Clears the text editor of all input sequences. |
| **Example** | Pre-fills the input box with sample FASTA sequences to demonstrate the required format. |

## 2. Tree Customization Options

The middle panel provides controls for adjusting the visual display of the generated tree.

### Plotting Options

| Control | Type | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Rectangular / Circular** | Radio Button | Toggles the overall layout style of the tree visualization. |
| **Show Labels** | Checkbox | Toggles the visibility of node and branch labels (e.g., branch lengths, confidence scores). |
| **Node Color** | Dropdown | Sets the color for the internal and external nodes of the tree. |
| **Line Color** | Dropdown | Sets the color for the branches/lines connecting the nodes. |
| **Line Style** | Dropdown | Sets the visual style of the branches (e.g., Solid, Dashed). |

### Size and Scale

Sliders allow for dynamic adjustment of various visual properties of the tree rendering:

| Slider | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Link Width** | Controls the thickness of the branches/lines in the tree. |
| **Resize** | A general slider likely used to scale the entire tree visualization area. |
| **Node Size** | Controls the size of the points representing the nodes (internal and terminal). |
| **Font Size** | Controls the size of the text labels for the sequence names and any associated data (e.g., branch lengths). |

### Download

The download buttons allow users to export the final tree visualization in various common image formats for use in reports or presentations.

* **SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics)**
* **PNG (Portable Network Graphics)**
* **JPEG (Joint Photographic Experts Group)**

## 3. Phylogenetic Tree Output

The bottom section displays the computed tree visualization.

* **Tree Structure:** Shows the hierarchical arrangement of sequences, with branches representing evolutionary time or distance. Sequences that share a closer branching point (closer to the right side of the visualization) are more closely related.
* **Root:** The starting point of the tree (labeled `Root` or similar) represents the common ancestor.
* **Nodes:** The branch points (internal nodes, labeled `Node 1`, `Node 2`, etc.) represent inferred common ancestors of the groups branching from them.
* **Labels (Terminal Nodes):** The leaves of the tree are the identifiers of the input sequences (e.g., `Camelina sativa | DH55 |...`).
