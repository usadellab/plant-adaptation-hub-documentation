# Introduction
 
The [Plant Adaptation Hub](https://www.camelina-hub.org) is a comprehensive web-based platform designed to empower scientists, farmers, and the general public with advanced tools and resources for Camelina research, farming, and exploration. 
This documentation provides an abstract knowledge of the key features which include: 

- the ability to perform genome-wide association studies (GWAS)
- identify significant genetic variations
- annotate genomic targets
- visualization of genetic diversity (PCA and MDS)
- visualization of phenotypic diversity

Please refer to Functional Modules on the left side column of this documentation for detailed exploration. The hub can be accessed at [www.camelina-hub.org](https://www.camelina-hub.org)
