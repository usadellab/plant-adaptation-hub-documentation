# About

The Plant Adaptation Hub is developed as part of the UNTWIST project, that operates on the fundamental principle of studying stress adaptation mechanisms in camelina, 
a naturally resilient European oilseed crop with minimal breeding, can unveil effective stress coping strategies. 
These strategies, once identified, can then be leveraged to enhance yield stability in camelina and other crops, especially in the face of challenging and shifting environmental conditions.
 UNTWIST is a unique, highly interdisciplinary consortium of four research organizations / institutes, one university, one commercial SME partner and two non-profit SMEs. 
These include:

- AIT AUSTRIAN INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY GMBH (AIT), AUSTRIA
- INSTITUT NATIONAL DE LA RECHERCHE AGRONOMIQUE (INRAE), FRANCE
- ROTHAMSTED RESEARCH (RRES), UNITED KINGDOM
- FORSCHUNGSZENTRUM JÜLICH GMBH (FZJ)
- UNIVERSITY OF BOLOGNA (UNIBO), ITALY
- CAMELINA COMPANY ESPAÑA S.L. (CCE), SPAIN
- INICIATIVAS INNOVADORAS (INI), SPAIN
