# Downloads Module

The **Downloads Module** allows users to download study-specific data from the database. This tool is particularly useful for researchers and data analysts looking to work with raw or curated experimental data related to Camelina *sativa*. The module supports downloading data in multiple formats and ensures that the data is contextually rich with associated metadata.

## Key Features

- **Study-Specific Data Downloads**: Users can download data for specific studies based on the selected experiment and assay.
- **Multiple Formats Supported**: Data can be downloaded in TSV (tab-separated values) format or as ARC-RO Crates for comprehensive and context-rich research object management.
- **Metadata Display**: Provides detailed metadata for each study, including the project title, description, duration, species, treatments, plant anatomical entity, and study identifier.

## How to Use

### 1. **Select Study**
   - From the dropdown, users can select a study title they are interested in. Each study contains multiple experiments with associated assays, locations, treatments, and plant anatomical entities.

### 2. **Select Experiment and Assay**
   - Once a study is selected, the module displays available **Experiments**. For each experiment, users can view relevant details, including:
     - **Locations**: Geographical locations where the experiment was conducted.
     - **Treatments**: Experimental conditions such as control, drought, or heat.
     - **Plant Anatomical Entity**: The plant part or tissue used in the experiment (e.g., aerial tissue, leaf).
     - **Time Points**: Time points for data collection (if available).

   - Users can choose the experiments they want by checking the relevant boxes in the **Select Assay** column.

### 3. **View Study Metadata**
   - On the right side of the interface, detailed metadata for the selected study is shown under **Study Overview**. This includes:
     - **Project**: The name of the project.
     - **Title**: The full title of the study.
     - **Description**: A brief description of the studyâ€™s objectives.
     - **Duration**: Start and end dates for the study.
     - **Species**: The species under investigation, such as *Camelina sativa*.
     - **Locations**: Where the study was conducted.
     - **Treatments**: The conditions applied to the experimental entities.
     - **Institutes Involved**: Institutions or research organizations responsible for the study.
     - **Plant Anatomical Entity**: The specific plant part used in the experiments.
     - **Study Identifier**: A unique identifier for the study (e.g., UNTWiST2.1).

### 4. **Download Data**
   - After selecting the desired experiments, users can download the data in one of two formats:
     - **TSV**: A tab-separated file for easy use in spreadsheets and statistical software.
     - **ARC-RO Crate**: A format based on annotated research context (ARC), which bundles data with metadata for richer data preservation and reproducibility.

   The download options are located at the bottom of the interface, allowing users to select the format they prefer.

## Importance for Researchers

This module provides a centralized and user-friendly interface for downloading experimental data. By offering detailed metadata alongside the data, it ensures that researchers can easily integrate the data into their own analyses. The ARC-RO Crate option allows for the preservation of experimental context, making it a valuable tool for data sharing and collaborative research. 

By supporting multiple download formats and providing structured, metadata-rich information, the **Downloads Module** significantly streamlines the process of accessing and utilizing Camelina-specific experimental data.
